All this script requires is Python 2.7 and an permanently active net-connection. 
To run the Bot, simply write the following command on the terminal:

        python logger.py


Once the logger starts, it will start loggin in the details in a text file named 
in the format "$current_date.txt". As long as the Internet is connected and the 
program (script) is running, it will keep loggin in the messages.

Note: Python 3.0+ is not supported currently.
